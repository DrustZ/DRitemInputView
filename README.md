# DRitemInputView
A Contact-picker style input view, making each item to a small view which enable multiple interactions.
Inspired by [THContactPicker](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/THContactPicker) and [MBContactPicker](https://github.com/Citrrus/MBContactPicker) but more flexible than them (This is just a light uiview and you can connect it with any ViewController), it doesn't has an extra uitableview, so just enjoy the pure UI component!
